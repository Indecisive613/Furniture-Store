# Furniture Store 

## Description  
Furniture Store is an a website where users can make fake furniture purchases. On the main page, users can add various types of furniture to their shopping cart. This project uses the browser's local storage, so reloading the page doesn't cause cart information to be lost.

Pressing the shopping cart icon in the top right hand corner brings the user to the checkout page where they can see the total bill along with all the items in their shopping cart. This page allows users to add or remove products from their shopping cart, to clear all items from the cart, or to proceed with payment.
